# Commander
Commander is a WIP Command framework to aid in the creation of command line tools.

## TODO
- Finish Unit tests.
- Add flag parser.
- Add argument preprocessor for commands ala discordpy ?
  E.g.: myFunc(string arg1, int arg2)
- Add code comments
- Add unit tests (aim for 100% coverage)
- Add code docs
- Add examples
- Prettify README.md
- This all could have gone in a project right?
